"""
Test utilities package (renamed from `tests.testing`).

This package contains light-weight mock classes and helpers for exercising
`server.network.aoprotocol.AOProtocol` without spinning up the full server
stack. They are intentionally minimal and only implement the surface used by
the tests. Extend them as more scenarios are covered.
